nCounter Troubleshooting Tool (nTT)

This project was one of the first .NET projects I created, serving to provide the Nanostring technical support team with a go to resource for nCounter platform troubleshooting and data quality evaluation. At the time this project started in late 2017 I had become generally familiar with C# language and LINQ and basically new enough to automate the stuff I needed to with decent performance. Learning more about ideal use of the elements of OOP came gradually over time and documentation ... became more consistent.

Functionality:
The purpose of including this repo on GitHub is just to demo the functionality I was able to include in the tool. The tool is able to load RCCs and/or MTX files, merge RCC and MTX from the same lanes of the same cartridge, find log files associated with the loaded MTX files, and import RLF and PKC files as needed via dialogs. The tool recursively scans zips and/or directories for all the file types it can ingest and creates of table of the loaded lanes (whether defined by RCCs, MTX, or both). 
Diagnostics, tables, and figures that can be created by the tool depend on the file types available with Gen2 and Gen2.5 MTX files allowing an automated log file analysis (Gen2 log analysis tool or Gen2LAT) specific to Max/Flex/Pro platforms and Gen3 (Sprint) MTX files allowing a Sprint-specific automated analysis (SLAT for Sprint log analysis tool). Both Gen2 and Gen3 analyses open in a tabbed control with pages for general info, summaries of the 3 sections of MTX files (CodeSummary, FOV lane averages, and string classes) plus pages for individual lanes as well as for focus calibration. Figures and tables are all copyable and saveable and some of the figures have an interactive function allowing users to explore signal traces at any resolution. In the case of the Gen2LAT and effort was made to do some level of automated diagnosing such that issue flags are ordered in the first summary page by priority of importance for the issue predicted to be the root cause.
